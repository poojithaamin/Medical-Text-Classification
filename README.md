# Medical-Text-Classification

Develop predictive models that can determine, given a medical abstract, which of 5 classes it falls in.
Medical abstracts describe the current conditions of a patient. Doctors routinely scan dozens or hundreds of abstracts each day as they do their rounds in a hospital and must quickly pick up on the salient information pointing to the patientâ€™s malady. The dataset, abstracts from 5 different conditions have been included: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, and general pathological conditions.
The goal of this project is to to develop predictive models that can determine, given a particular medical abstract, which one of 5 classes it belongs to.
